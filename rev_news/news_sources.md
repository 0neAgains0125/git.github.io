title: Git Rev News Sources

Some ideas on where we can go to gather Git Rev News material.

## Mailing lists

* Git dev
* Git for Windows
* JGit 
* libgit2 (and friends)
* ...

## Blogs (the RSS-feeds can be aggregated into one shared resource)

* Junio's blog
* Company blogs of GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.
* ...

## Forums

* Hacker News (can be monitored using Google Alerts)
* Reddit/git (offers RSS)
* Git community on Google+
* ...

# Process

* For every upcoming edition, post a mail/thread to the Git dev list asking
  if there's anything anyone want included in the upcoming edition.
* Also, post an issue on github.com/git/news asking for 
  comments/contributions from the community as a whole (anyone can 
  comment on this issue).
* The GitHub issue can also be used to gather interesting links that we find
  on the above sources. Each interesting link is just added as a comment.
* At the end of the month, paste it all into an .md file that goes into some
  sort of blog on git.github.io/news
