title: Git Rev News Sources

Some ideas on where we can go to gather Git Rev News material.

## Mailing lists

* Git dev
* Git for Windows
* JGit 
* libgit2 (and friends)
* ...

## Blogs (the RSS-feeds can be aggregated into one shared resource)

* Junio's blog
* Company blogs of GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.
* ...

## Forums

* Hacker News (can be monitored using Google Alerts)
* Reddit/git (offers RSS)
* Git community on Google+
* ...

# Process

For every upcoming edition, do the following:

* Create a new edition-[number].md file in some draft directory.
* Post a mail/thread to the Git dev list asking if
  there's anything anyone wants included in the upcoming edition.
* Post an issue in this GitHub repository asking for 
  comments/contributions - anyone can comment on this, or send pull-
  requests for editing the edition.md file.
* When the time comes to release the edition, move the edition.md file
  into some designated publishing directory, so it appears in
  the feed on git.github.io/rev_news/.
