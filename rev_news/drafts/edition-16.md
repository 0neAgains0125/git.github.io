## Discussions

### General

* [proposal for extending smudge/clean filters with raw file access](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/294425)

Joey Hess, who is the [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)
main developer and maintainer, sent an email with some suggestions to
extend smudge/clean filters.

Smudge/clean filters can be used to automatically perform
transformations on the content when it is checked into Git or out of
it. This can be used for example to perform keyword substitution like
Subversion or CVS allows with keywords named '$Id$', '$Rev$' or
'$Author$'.

The idea is that these filters would call git-annex automatically and
git-annex could decide, when a file is added, if its content should
indeed by handled regularly by the Git repo or if it should be handled
by git-annex. In a similar way when a file is checked out, git-annex
would be called and could get the file content it by itself if it is
managing the file.

Joey's suggestions on the mailing list were the following:

```
I'm using smudge/clean filters in git-annex now, and it's not been an
entirely smooth fit between the interface and what git-annex wants
to do.

...

So I propose extending the filter driver with two more optional
commands. Call them raw-clean and raw-smudge for now.

raw-clean would be like clean, but rather than being fed the whole
content of a large file on stdin, it would be passed the filename, and
can access the file itself. Like the clean filter, it outputs the
cleaned version on stdout.

raw-smudge would be like smudge, but rather than needing to output the
whole content of a large file on stdout, it would be passed a filename,
and can create that file itself.
```

After discussing those new commands with Junio Hamano, the Git
maintainer, it looks like patches to add them could be accepted. The
names "clean-from-fs" and "smudge-to-fs" have been suggested for them.

* [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/295135](Odd Difference Between Windows Git and Standard Git)

Jon Forrest sent an email about a `git status` behavior he sees on
Windows, which is different than on Linux on a repository that is
shared between the two environments. On Windows it looks like "every
.pdf file and some .png files are modified".

Torsten BÃ¶gershausen, who has been working on Windows compatibility
lately, especially related to line ending, first asked Jon some basic
questions:

```
What does
git diff
say ?

What does
git config -l | grep core
say ?

And what does
git ls-files --eol
say?
```

As Jon answered:

```
old mode 100755
new mode 100644
```

Torsten replied:

```
So the solution is to run
git config core.filemode false
```

Jon replied:

```
This worked perfectly!

I wonder if this should be the default for Git for Windows.
```

To which Torsten replied:

```
It is.
But you need to clone the repo under Windows.

I probably submit a patch some day, that core.filemode will be ignored
under Windows.
```

From further discussions, it appeared that, when cloning a repo or
when using `git init`, we probe to see if the executable bit "sticks"
to the files and we set the 'core.filemode' config variable
accordingly. That works well, but we don't probe at other times, so it
doesn't work well for repos that are shared using a network filesystem
or Dropbox.

To try to fix that, Torsten suggested a patch so that the
'core.filemode' setting is ignored under Windows. The problem with
that, is that dictating "for all eternity that Git for Windows cannot
determine the executable bit" might not be a good long term strategy,
as "who knows for certain?".

Johannes Schindelin, the Git for Windows maintainer, suggested making
the default 'core.filemode' setting platform-dependent. This last
solution is already used for end of line setting. But it doesn't fix
the problem when a repo created on Linux, where 'core.filemode' has
been automatically set to true at init time, is shared.

Another solution would be to probe more often than just when cloning
or using `git init`, but it appears that we don't want to do that for
each command and it is not clear how to easily probe when there might
not even be a '.git' directory.

The conclusion from the thread is that unfortunately it looks like
there is no simple solution to avoid this kind of problems for now.

## Releases

* git-multimail [1.3.0](https://github.com/git-multimail/git-multimail/releases/tag/1.3.0) and
  [1.3.1](https://github.com/git-multimail/git-multimail/releases/tag/1.3.1) were released,
  with a focus on options to customize emails, more documentation and
  a few SMTP-related improvements.
