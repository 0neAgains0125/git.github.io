## Discussions

### General

* Discussions at the Git Contributor Summit, part 2, about misc topics

At the Git Contributor Summit on April 4th, just after the lunch
break, the state of the participation of the Git project in the Google
Summer of Code (GSoC) and Outreachy was briefly mentioned, then Jeff
King, alias Peff, talked about the state of the Git project as part of
the [Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC)](https://sfconservancy.org/).

Git is one of the SFC Member Projects. The SFC manages the legal and
administrative aspects of the Git project. The SFC also manages Git's
money, which amounts to around $20000. This money comes mostly from
donations made on git-scm.org, GSoC mentor stipends and book
royalties. The money has been used in the past to pay for some
developers to travel to conferences like Git Merge. It may be used in
the future to pay Outreachy student stipends.

The governance of the Git project as part of the SFC is in the hands
of Junio Hamano, Shawn Pearce and Jeff King. The main activity of the
governance consists in handling trademark issues related to the "Git"
trademark that the project owns.

There are a number of projects who call themselves Git XXX and the
trademark policy on git-scm.org is used to decide if those trademarks
are approved or not.

Another activity is related to defending the license which is the
GPL. There have been some vendors who distributed Git with some
changes, but did not provide the source code of the Git version they
distributed. For now it has been possible to resolve these cases, but
it is not completely clear if some vendors currently fullfill all
their obligations. In case some developers who contributed to Git
wants to take a close look at what the vendors are doing, the SFC can
help them.
