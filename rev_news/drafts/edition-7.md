* [t5004: test ZIP archives with many entries](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/275682/focus=276393)

Johannes Schauer reported that git-archive does not use the zip64
extension and therefore is unable to properly create zip archives with
more than 16k entries.

René Scharfe agreed that there is a problem. It comes from the fact
that without the zip64 extension, the zip field for the number of
entries has only two bytes. The limit is then 65535 entries.

René then sent a patch series to add tests for this problem and then
fix it. The first patch contains the following code, which tests that
a suitable `zipinfo` command is available on the current machine, and
sets the ZIPINFO prerequesite if this is the case:

```
+ZIPINFO=zipinfo
+
+test_lazy_prereq ZIPINFO '
+	n=$("$ZIPINFO" "$TEST_DIRECTORY"/t5004/empty.zip | sed -n "2s/.* //p")
+	test "x$n" = "x0"
+'
```

Eric Sunshine replied that unfortunately the above would work neither
on MacOS X where the `zipinfo` output is different, nor on FreeBSD
where `zipinfo` has been removed in favor of `unzip -Z`.

Eric then discussed in details the possibility of using `unzip -Z`
instead of `zipinfo` to have a portable test, but it appears that this
doesn't work well on files using the zip64 extension on MacOS X and
FreeBSD .

After further discussing this, Eric, René and Junio agreed that it was
good enough that the patch and the above `zipinfo` check work on Linux
as we don't need to test the archive generated by `git archive` on
every platform.
