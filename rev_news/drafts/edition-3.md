## Git Rev News: Edition 3 (May 13, 2015)

Welcome to the second edition of [Git Rev News](http://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news.html),
a digest of all things Git, written collaboratively
on [GitHub](https://github.com/git/git.github.io) by volunteers.

Our goal is to aggregate and communicate
some of the activities on the [Git mailing list](mailto:git@vger.kernel.org)
in a format that the wider tech community can follow
and understand. In addition, we'll link to some of the interesting Git-related
articles, tools and projects we come across.

This edition still covers Git's 10th year of existence, as well as the
[Git Merge](http://git-merge.com) conference held on April 8th & 9th in Paris,
France. Git developers and users alike came together to celebrate the
anniversary, and to discuss the current challenges of using and scaling Git.

You can contribute to the upcoming edition by sending [pull
requests](https://github.com/git/git.github.io/pulls) or opening
[issues](https://github.com/git/git.github.io/issues).
