## Git Rev News: Edition 34 (December 20th, 2017)

Welcome to the 34th edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](http://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened during the month of November 2017.

## Discussions

### General

* Thank you Thomas and call for help!

From the beginning in March 2015, Thomas Ferris Nicolaisen very
actively contributed to many aspects of Git Rev News. He especially
was the main contributor and editor of the [Other News](#other news)
and [Releases](#releases) sections. He also reviewed and merged a
large number of pull requests and did a lot to improve Git Rev News in
general.

Unfortunately, as his daily work has been focusing on higher level
things like agile and DevOps for some time, he asked to be
de-installed from being an editor.

As there is more and more to do to have a relevant, vibrant and
entertaining news letter for the Git Community, we are thanking Thomas
for his huge contribution, and looking for other people to join our
small Git Rev News editor team.

There is no need to even know Git well for that. It's possible to
participate by just gathering articles about Git, or just checking
which are the latest releases for example. Please contact us (see our
emails [at the bottom](#credits)) if you are interested.
