* [v2.11 new diff heuristic?](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAHd499AjXh1YnVgBj_8j0fgvOgOn53y+sPBBy6y7mSM-+dCyVw@mail.gmail.com/)

Eight days before the v2.11.0 Git release, Robert Dailey asked on the
mailing list if there would be a new diff heuristic in the new release:

> I dug into the git diff documentation here:
>
> https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff
>
> It mentions a "--compaction-heuristic" option. Is this the new
> heuristic outlined by the release notes? If not, which is it? Is the
> compaction heuristic compatible with the histogram diff algorithm? Is
> there a config option to turn this on all the time? For that matter,

>
> There's still so much more about this feature I would like to know.

Stefan Beller answered most of Robert's questions saying that indeed
the "--compaction-heuristic" option is the new heuristic, and it is
compatible with the histogram diff algorithm "as the compaction
heuristic is applied after the actual diff is performed".

Stefan also said that 'diff.compactionHeuristic' is the config option
to turn this heuristic on and that "the background story (and what
this new compaction heuristic is doing) is found at
[Michael Haggerty's diff-slider-tools repository](https://github.com/mhagger/diff-slider-tools)".

But Jeff King, alias Peff, who works with Michael for GitHub, replied
that the above 'compaction heuristic' is about "the 'old' attempt at a
similar feature from v2.9. The 'new' one goes by the name
'--indent-heuristic' (and 'diff.indentHeuristic' in the config).

Peff added that "more discussion about how it works" can be found in
the commit message of
[Michael's commit that introduces the 'indent heuristic'](https://github.com/git/git/commit/433860f3d0beb0c6f205290bd16cda413148f098).

This commit message indeed looks impressive and shows that a lot of
work has been going on for a long time to improve the diff
heuristics. It can make one wonder if Git developers are soon going to
use artificial intelligence algorithms to train a neural networks to
give the best possible diffs.

Anyway Jacob Keller also answered saying that the config option is
undocumented and that:

> Currently it is being evaluated and likely we want to make it default
> in the near future once we are certain that it helps and doesn't make
> any difference worse.
>
> So long term you will not need any special knobs to benefit.

Peff agreed that "it is not the default in v2.11, but it probably
will become so in a future version."

Later in the [GitHub blog post about the v2.11 release](https://github.com/blog/2288-git-2-11-has-been-released),
Peff mentioned this new (undocumented but testable) feature.

It's interesting to see that users are interested in better diff
algorithms, and that Git developers provide them with new advanced
options to play with before hopefully improving the default
algorithms.

* [trustExitCode doesn't apply to vimdiff mergetool](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAD03jn5PAZcFeesaq2osjo7cYd1frWZeN0odNqTh+AMxSEmLgQ@mail.gmail.com/)

Dun Peal wrote that he is using vimdiff as his mergetool, and has the
'mergetool.vimdiff.trustExitCode' configuration option set to 'true'
in his ~/.gitconfig file. Nervertheless when he makes vimdiff exit
with code 1 (to mean failure), Git still acts as if the merge has
succeeded.

From the documentation of 'mergetool.vimdiff.trustExitCode' he
expected that with such an exit code Git would consider that the merge
hasn't been successful.

Jeff King, alias Peff, replied that the configuration variable "is
used only for a 'user' tool, not for the builtin tool profiles". And,
while vimdiff has a builtin tool profile, Peff suggested a workaround
that configured vimdiff as a user tool.

Dun then wrote that he would find more sensible that by default Git
would rely on the exit code from the tool, and that he hopes the
developers change this default, or at least let users override it for
the builtin invocations.

Peff replied:

> Yeah, I'm inclined to agree. But like I said, I'm not too familiar with
> this area, so maybe there are subtle things I'm missing.

Junio Hamano later explained that "some tools are known to give unusable
exit codes, so we ignore their exit codes by default."

As Peff had said that he doesn't use mergetools, Dun also asked:

> Finally, if you're not using mergetools, how do you resolve conflicts?

Peff replied that he just edits the conflicted sections in vim and
uses [git-jump](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/git-jump).

In the meantime, David Aguilar, who previously contributing a lot to
mergetool, sent a patch to allow "tools to opt-in to
trustExitCode=true". He warned though that for tkdiff and kdiff3, his
patch has "a subtle change in behavior, but not one that should be
problematic."

So David later sent another patch that "allow tools to advertise their
own default value for trustExitCode, so that users do not need to
opt-in to the original behavior".

Peff and Junio reviewed the patches and found them mostly good, though
they suggested some small improvements.

David has since posted
[new patches](https://public-inbox.org/git/20161129093807.24637-1-davvid@gmail.com/)
that have been found "sensible", so it looks likely then that this
area of Git will improve in the next feature version.
