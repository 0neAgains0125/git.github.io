## Git Rev News: Edition 2 (April ???, 2015)

Welcome to the second edition of [Git Rev News](http://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news.html),
a digest of all things Git, written collaboratively
on [GitHub](https://github.com/git/git.github.io) by volunteers.

Our goal is to aggregate and communicate
some of the activities on the [Git mailing list](mailto:git@vger.kernel.org)
in a format that the wider tech community can follow
and understand. In addition, we'll link to some of the interesting Git-related
articles, tools and projects we come across.

This edition covers what happened during ???.

You can contribute to the upcoming edition by sending [pull
requests](https://github.com/git/git.github.io/pulls) or opening
[issues](https://github.com/git/git.github.io/issues).
