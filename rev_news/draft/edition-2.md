## Git Rev News: Edition 2 (April 15, 2015), 10 years of Git & Git Merge 2015!

Welcome to the second edition of [Git Rev News](http://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news.html),
a digest of all things Git, written collaboratively
on [GitHub](https://github.com/git/git.github.io) by volunteers.

Our goal is to aggregate and communicate
some of the activities on the [Git mailing list](mailto:git@vger.kernel.org)
in a format that the wider tech community can follow
and understand. In addition, we'll link to some of the interesting Git-related
articles, tools and projects we come across.

This special edition covers Git's 10th anniversary and
the [Git Merge 2015](git-merge.com) on April 8th & 9th in Paris, France,
where many Git fans celebrated this anniversary. 

You can contribute to the upcoming edition by sending [pull
requests](https://github.com/git/git.github.io/pulls) or opening
[issues](https://github.com/git/git.github.io/issues).
