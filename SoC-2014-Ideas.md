title: SoC 2014 Ideas
---

This is the idea page for Summer of Code 2014. Please write up any
potential ideas here, and mention:

  1. A general description. What is the idea?

  2. What is the expected deliverable?

  3. What the student needs to know (C? Shell?) and the approximate
     difficulty.

  4. Possible mentors (this should generally be you, if you are
     proposing it. Please add a backup mentor if you can find one).

More guidance is available in the [GSoC FAQ](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page#3._What_is_an_Ideas_list).
