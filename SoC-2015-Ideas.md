title: SoC 2015 Ideas
---

This is the idea page for Summer of Code 2015 for Git and libgit2.

## About applying for SoC with the Git project

It is required that students who want to apply to the Git
project for the Summer of Code 2015 complete a tiny, code-related
"microproject" as part of their application.  Please refer to our
[guidelines and suggestions for microprojects](http://git.github.io/SoC-2015-Microprojects.html)
for more information. Completing a microproject is not only an important
way for us to get experience with applicants, but it will also help
applicants become familiar with Git's development and submission
process.

## Summer of code main project ideas

**Students**: Please consider these ideas as starting points for
generating proposals.  We are also more than happy to receive
proposals for other ideas related to Git or libgit2.

*TODO* add entries :)
